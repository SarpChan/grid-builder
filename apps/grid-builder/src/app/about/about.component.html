    Thank you for using Grid Builder! This tool was created to help you design
    and generate CSS grid layouts.
  </p>
  <p>
    Grid Builder is a free and open-source project built using Angular and
    Tailwind CSS. The code is available on
    <a
      class="hover:underline text-gray-400"
      href="https://github.com/SarpChan/grid-builder"
      target="_blank"
      >Github</a
    >. Feel free to contribute to the project or open an issue if you find a
    bug.

    Grid Builder does not phone home or make any request for that matter.
    Everything runs local, files you upload are not analyzed and do not leave
    your computer. Downloaded files are generated on the fly and are not stored.
